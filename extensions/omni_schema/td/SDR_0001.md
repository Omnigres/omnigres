# Create and delete table

## Create table

Create a table if it's missing in old schema but present in new one.

```postgresql
-- old schema

-- new schema
create table t
(
    i int
);
```

## Delete table

Delete a table if it's missing in new schema but present in old one.

```postgresql
-- old schema
create table t
(
    i int
);

-- new schema
```

## Ambiguity

Can't differentiate between rename of a table and create/delete of table. The following
will be interpreted as delete of `t1` and create of `t2` according to the above rules but the intention may be to rename
the table from `t1` to `t2`.

```postgresql
-- old schema
create table t1
(
    i int
);

-- new schema
create table t2
(
    i int
);
```
