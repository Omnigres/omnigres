# Create/Delete column in a table

## Create a column

Create a column in the table if a new schema has an additional column
compared to old one.

```postgresql
-- old version
create table t
(
    i int
);

-- new version
create table t
(
    i int,
    j int
);
```

## Delete a column

Delete a column if old schema has an additional column compared to
new one.

```postgresql
-- old version
create table t
(
    i int,
    j int
);

-- new version
create table t
(
    i int
);
```

## Ambiguity

Create and delete of a column is straightforward if it's the last
column of the table.

But doing it somewhere in the middle of a table is ambiguous with rename of a column.
The following could mean rename of `j` to `k` and add a new column `j` or adding a new
column `k` between `i` and `j`.

```postgresql
-- old version
create table t
(
    i int,
    j int
);

-- new version
create table t
(
    i int,
    k int,
    j int
);
```
