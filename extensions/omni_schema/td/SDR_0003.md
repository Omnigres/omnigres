# Change in column attribute

If the number of columns is same in both old and new schema, match the columns
by their ordinal position to detect any changes in their attributes (name, type, default values, constraints, etc).

The following changes the name of column `i` and type of column `j`

```postgresql
-- old version
create table t
(
    i int,
    j int
);

-- new version
create table t
(
    k int,
    j bigint
);
```

## Ambiguity

The following is detected as rename of columns `i` and `j` to `j` and `i` respectively but it could also be
interpreted as changing the order of columns within a table.

```postgresql
-- old version
create table t
(
    i int,
    j int
);

-- new version
create table t
(
    j int,
    i int
);
```
